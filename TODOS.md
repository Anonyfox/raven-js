# Todos

simple task list file what to implement next for short term goals.

- [ ] replace the typedoc tool with [glean](./packages/glean/README.md) once
      its working good enough. current state of JSDoc tools is unsatisfactory.
- [ ] identify potential issues of beak from the glean project since this
      type of project should uncover lots of rendering edgecases
- [ ] flesh out SPA capabilities until [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) can be implemented nicely as an example app
- [ ] design and build the RavenJS website with raven itself, deploy in SSG mode

# **Beak Performance Optimization Challenge - Reset Prompt**

## **Context & Objective**

You are optimizing the RavenJS Beak templating engine, which currently ranks **8th out of 9 engines** in performance benchmarks, running **24.76x slower** than the fastest (doT). Your goal is to dramatically improve performance while maintaining the elegant developer experience that makes Beak superior.

**Current Performance:**

- **Beak:** 3.27ms avg, 306 renders/sec, rank 8/9
- **Target competitors:** doT (0.13ms), Pug (0.19ms), Eta (0.23ms)
- **Benchmark:** 1000 iterations rendering 90 blog posts with complex metadata

## **Critical Requirements**

1. **Zero API Changes:** All optimizations must be completely transparent and internal-only
2. **Maintain Functionality:** Test suite must pass after every change
3. **V8 Engine Focus:** Leverage V8-specific optimizations and patterns
4. **Measured Approach:** Benchmark after each optimization to track real impact
5. **RavenJS Philosophy:** Embody the raven's predatory intelligence - surgical precision, zero waste
6. **Automatic Rollback:** If any optimization makes performance worse, immediately revert all changes

## **Benchmark Environment**

```bash
# Location
cd /Users/fox/projects/github.com/Anonyfox/ravenjs/examples/renderer-benchmark

# Run benchmark
node benchmark.js

# Run tests
cd ../packages/beak && npm test
```

**Benchmark Template Characteristics:**

- Complex component-based structure with many nested `html`` calls
- 90 blog posts with full metadata (titles, authors, dates, tags, content)
- Heavy use of array mapping and conditional rendering
- Mostly exercises the general case, not edge cases

## **Previous Failed Attempts - Key Learnings**

**Strategy That Failed:** Adding conditional fast paths for edge cases
**Result:** Every optimization made performance worse (-6% to -9% degradation)

### **Failed Optimizations:**

1. **Static template fast path:** -6.7% (extra conditional overhead)
2. **Direct string concatenation:** -9.2% (branching cost exceeded benefits)
3. **Inline primitive processing:** -3.7% (complex conditional chains)
4. **Hidden class cache optimization:** -5.8% (Map→Object conversion didn't help)

### **Critical Insights:**

- **Conditional overhead exceeds benefits:** Each `if` statement adds branching cost
- **Optimize general case, not edges:** Benchmark exercises complex templates, not simple ones
- **Profile actual hot paths:** Don't guess what needs optimization
- **V8 works best with consistent patterns:** Breaking existing patterns hurts performance

## **Strategic Optimization Approaches**

### **1. Code Elimination Strategy**

- **Remove total executed code** wherever possible - leaner = faster
- **Eliminate unnecessary function calls, loops, and operations**
- **Even optimizations can backfire** if they introduce too much branching or cache-state-tracking
- **Prefer deletion over addition** - the fastest code is code that doesn't run

### **2. Algorithmic Rethinking**

- **Question fundamental assumptions** about how templating should work
- **Identify completely different approaches** to implementing the same requirements
- **Consider compile-time vs runtime tradeoffs**
- **Rethink data flow and processing order** for optimal V8 behavior

### **3. Template Literal Exploitation**

- **Leverage unique characteristics** of JavaScript template literals
- **Functions are objects** - exploit all capabilities this brings
- **Template strings have static/dynamic parts** - preprocess what's possible
- **Track inner/outer contexts** if it enables performance gains
- **Use closure scope** and lexical binding creatively for speed

### **4. V8-Native Minimalism**

- **Write absolutely minimalistic implementations** optimally designed for V8
- **Use modern JS types** available in Node 22+ and modern browsers
- **Leverage newest language features** for optimal performance
- **Eliminate legacy compatibility code** that adds overhead
- **Design data structures** that V8 optimizes heavily

### **5. Memory-Speed Tradeoffs**

- **Trade additional memory for increased throughput** where reasonable
- **Use caching, memoization, precomputation** when beneficial
- **Implement bound-checking** to avoid sudden memory spikes
- **Consider object pooling** for frequently allocated structures
- **Balance memory pressure** vs garbage collection impact

### **6. Hot Path Intelligence**

- **Trace actual execution paths** in the benchmark scenario
- **Profile what code runs 1000+ times** vs what runs once
- **Find creative, novel approaches** to tackle bottlenecks
- **Think outside traditional templating patterns**
- **Exploit benchmark-specific characteristics** if universally applicable

## **Current Code Structure**

**Main files to analyze:**

- `/packages/beak/core/html/template-renderer.js` - Core rendering logic
- `/packages/beak/core/html/stringify.js` - Value conversion
- `/packages/beak/core/html/escape-special-characters.js` - XSS protection
- `/examples/renderer-benchmark/templates/beak.js` - Benchmark template

**Hot Path Analysis Needed:**

- `_renderTemplate()` function handles most complex cases
- `fastNormalize()` called on every template result
- Array allocation and string joining patterns
- Multiple nested `html`` calls in component structure

## **V8 Optimization Opportunities**

Focus on patterns V8 optimizes heavily:

- **Monomorphic function signatures** (consistent call patterns)
- **Hidden class stability** (consistent object shapes)
- **Escape analysis** (stack-allocatable objects)
- **Function inlining** (small, hot functions)
- **Branch prediction** (consistent conditional patterns)
- **String optimization** (rope strings, internalization)
- **Array optimization** (consistent element types)

## **Implementation Protocol**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Establish baseline:** Record current performance metrics
2. **Apply single optimization:** Make one focused change
3. **Run tests:** Ensure functionality remains intact
4. **Benchmark immediately:** Measure actual performance impact
5. **Evaluate result:**
   - **If improvement:** Continue to next optimization
   - **If degradation:** **IMMEDIATELY ROLLBACK** all changes
6. **Document learnings:** Record what worked/failed and why

### **Rollback Rule:**

```bash
# If benchmark shows worse performance:
git checkout packages/beak/core/html/template-renderer.js  # Revert changes
git checkout packages/beak/core/html/stringify.js         # Revert if modified
# Continue only with approaches that show measurable improvement
```

## **Success Criteria**

- **Target:** 5-8x performance improvement (3.27ms → 0.4-0.6ms range)
- **Ranking goal:** Move from rank 8/9 to rank 3-4 (competitive with Eta/Mustache)
- **Method:** Internal optimizations only, zero API surface changes
- **Validation:** Tests pass, benchmarks improve consistently
- **Quality:** Each optimization must show measurable improvement or be discarded

## **Advanced Optimization Ideas**

### **Template Literal Exploitation:**

- **Static analysis** of template structure at runtime
- **Precompiled render functions** for repeated patterns
- **Context-aware optimization** based on usage patterns
- **Closure-based state management** for hot templates

### **V8-Specific Techniques:**

- **Typed arrays** for consistent data structures
- **WeakMap/WeakSet** for efficient metadata tracking
- **Symbol properties** for hidden object state
- **Proxy objects** for intelligent interception (if beneficial)
- **SharedArrayBuffer** for memory-efficient caching (if applicable)

### **Novel Approaches:**

- **Template compilation pipeline** that generates optimized functions
- **Hot template detection** with specialized renderers
- **Memory-mapped template cache** for instant reuse
- **Streaming template assembly** to reduce allocation pressure

**Your Mission:** Apply raven-level intelligence to transform Beak from wounded prey into apex predator. Use any combination of the above strategies, but maintain the iron discipline of **immediate rollback** for any change that degrades performance. The fastest code is often the simplest code - eliminate before you optimize.

**Remember:** Intelligence over ideology. Measure what matters. **Every line of code is guilty until proven beneficial.**
