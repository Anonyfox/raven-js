> **Raven's reconnaissance intelligence** - Zero-dependency digital fingerprinting and security assessment library

Eye provides surgical precision for reconnaissance intelligence - comprehensive digital fingerprinting, security assessment, competitive analysis, and vulnerability discovery. Built with zero dependencies and modern JavaScript, it delivers the sharp reconnaissance tools needed for apex predator intelligence gathering.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @raven-js/eye
```

## Usage

```javascript
import * as dns from "@raven-js/eye/dns";
import * as security from "@raven-js/eye/security";
import * as intel from "@raven-js/eye/intel";

// DNS reconnaissance
const subdomains = await dns.findSubdomains('example.com');
const hosting = await dns.getHostingInfo('example.com');

// Security assessment
const exposedFiles = await security.findExposedFiles('https://example.com');
const vulnerabilities = await security.findSecurityIssues('https://example.com');

// Complete intelligence gathering
const report = await intel.fullRecon('https://example.com');
console.log(report.critical); // Critical security issues found
```

## Reconnaissance Modules

- **DNS** - Subdomain enumeration, hosting detection, email configuration analysis
- **HTTP** - Server fingerprinting, security headers, infrastructure detection
- **Security** - Vulnerability discovery, exposed file detection, attack surface mapping
- **Tech** - Technology stack identification, platform detection, competitive intelligence
- **Assets** - Resource discovery, dependency mapping, performance analysis
