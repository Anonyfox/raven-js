/**

 *
 * This module contains simple Bootstrap5 components for building typical web
 * pages. Import things from `@raven-js/beak/bootstrap` to quickly build your nest.
 *
 * Drop any recent bootstrap.css file in your public folder and include it in your
 * HTML file to use these components. Bootstrap is no longer the hipster choice,
 * but it's still a solid (mature!) option for rapid prototyping and production
 * and has a huge community behind it as well as a vast ecosystem of plugins, plus
 * web agencies and seasoned freelancers probably can work with it blindfolded.
