# DOCS

Create surgical documentation with mathematically precise JSDoc types. Target: perfect type safety, API clarity, AI-native design with platform-native efficiency.

## Template

**Read CODEX.md first.** Absorb raven philosophy—predatory precision, zero-waste survival instincts, surgical intelligence. All documentation must embody this spirit: lean, intelligent language that experienced developers expect.

**Write with surgical compression:**

- Strip fluff words: "comprehensive," "rigorous," "extensive"—ravens understand thoroughness is implied
- Convert verbose paragraphs to scanning-optimized bullet points
- Eliminate redundant explanations—information lives in exactly one location
- Use active voice, present tense: "Document errors" not "Errors should be documented"
- Compress concepts to essential actions: "Create checklist" not "Create a detailed and rigorously in-depth checklist"
- Choose precise verbs over adjective-heavy descriptions
- Target experienced developers—skip hand-holding, assume competence

**Analyze purpose before execution.** Every file serves specific communication patterns—respect and optimize them.

**Create comprehensive task checklist.** List every function, type, edge case, performance characteristic, and integration pattern requiring documentation. Maintain actively—roadmap and completeness tracker.

**Execute file-by-file, foundational to dependent.** Achieve perfect JSDoc accuracy and complete API coverage before moving forward. Non-negotiable.

**Document surgically:**

- **Type Precision**: Exact JSDoc annotations matching runtime behavior. Union types, generics, conditionals.
- **Performance Alerts**: Only when genuinely exceptional or surprisingly expensive. Proven measurements only.
- **Critical Errors**: Non-obvious failures requiring specific handling. Skip obvious TypeErrors.
- **Platform Gotchas**: Actual compatibility issues or version-specific behaviors. Skip generic requirements.
- **Integration Traps**: Surprising composition behaviors or specific safety requirements. Skip obvious usage.
- **Dangerous Edges**: Unexpected behaviors with edge inputs. Skip defensive null checks.

**Eliminate redundancy.** Information lives in exactly one authoritative location. No duplication, padding, or repetition.

**Verify complete coverage.** Enable confident integration, prevent usage errors, serve as definitive specification for public interfaces.

**Resolve all type errors and linter issues.**
