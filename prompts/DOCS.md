# DOCUMENTATION DOCTRINE

**Read CODEX.md first.** Ravens document with predatory truth—surgical precision, mathematical accuracy, evolutionary maintenance. Documentation that lies kills territories through integration failures and developer betrayal.

## MANDATORY STATUTE

**Every raven must follow this doctrine without exception. Outdated documentation is enemy intelligence that sabotages the murder.**

### Article I: Documentation Archaeology Mandate

**Before touching any code territory, audit all existing documentation for truth.** Implementation evolves, docs fossilize into deadly lies. Every documentation session begins with archaeological investigation.

**Mandatory audit protocol:**

1. Compare current JSDoc types against actual runtime behavior
2. Verify examples execute successfully with current implementation
3. Validate performance claims against current benchmarks
4. Test integration patterns against current API surfaces
5. Hunt deprecated patterns, outdated function signatures, stale edge case handling

### Article II: Synchronous Evolution Law

**When implementation changes, documentation must evolve simultaneously.** No code commit without corresponding documentation truth updates. Asynchronous documentation creates integration traps that kill developer confidence.

**Change-triggered update requirements:**

- Function signature modifications → Immediate JSDoc type updates
- Behavior changes → Updated description and edge case documentation
- Performance shifts → Revised benchmark claims or warnings
- API surface evolution → Integration example updates
- Error handling changes → Exception documentation accuracy

### Article III: Optimization During Maintenance

**Every documentation touch becomes optimization opportunity.** Compress verbose explanations, eliminate redundant information, merge scattered details into surgical precision. Documentation must become leaner and more intelligent with each evolution.

**Continuous improvement mandate:**

- Strip fluff words: "comprehensive," "rigorous," "extensive"—ravens understand thoroughness is implied
- Convert verbose paragraphs to scanning-optimized bullet points
- Eliminate redundant explanations—information lives in exactly one location
- Use active voice, present tense: "Document errors" not "Errors should be documented"
- Choose precise verbs over adjective-heavy descriptions

### Article IV: Mathematical Type Precision

JSDoc annotations must match runtime behavior exactly. No defensive types, no aspirational descriptions, no legacy compatibility lies.

**Required accuracy standards:**

- **Union Types**: Exact possible value sets, not defensive generics
- **Generic Constraints**: Precise type boundaries matching implementation
- **Conditional Returns**: Accurate type flows based on input conditions
- **Exception Signatures**: Specific error types and trigger conditions
- **Performance Characteristics**: Measured complexity, not theoretical estimates

### Article V: Staleness Elimination Protocol

**Hunt and destroy outdated claims proactively.** Scan documentation for fossilized information that no longer reflects current territorial reality.

**Active staleness detection:**

- Performance claims from previous implementations
- Integration examples using deprecated patterns
- Edge case handling that was refactored away
- Function descriptions describing old algorithmic approaches
- Type definitions that predate implementation evolution

### Article VI: Surgical Content Standards

Document only information that prevents integration failures or reveals non-obvious behaviors. Skip obvious patterns, defensive explanations, hand-holding content.

**Document surgically:**

- **Performance Alerts**: Only genuinely exceptional or surprisingly expensive behaviors
- **Critical Errors**: Non-obvious failures requiring specific handling
- **Platform Gotchas**: Actual compatibility issues, not generic requirements
- **Integration Traps**: Surprising composition behaviors or safety requirements
- **Dangerous Edges**: Unexpected behaviors with edge inputs

### Article VII: Truth Verification Mandate

**Every documentation claim must be immediately verifiable.** Examples must execute, types must match runtime, performance claims must reflect measurements, integration patterns must work with current implementation.

**Verification requirements:**

1. Execute all code examples successfully
2. Validate JSDoc types against actual function behavior
3. Confirm performance characteristics through measurement
4. Test integration patterns against current API surfaces
5. Verify error handling documentation matches implementation

---

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**: Outdated documentation creates integration failures. False type information sabotages developer tooling. Stale examples waste developer time and erode trust.

**SURVIVAL REWARD**: Documentation that teaches truth, enables confident integration, evolves intelligently with implementation, and becomes more precise with each territorial evolution.

_The murder's documentation doctrine: Truth through evolution, precision through maintenance, intelligence through continuous optimization._
