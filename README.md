## What is RavenJS?

RavenJS is a **swift web dev toolkit** - a collection of focused, zero-dependency JavaScript libraries designed for developers who've had enough of framework fatigue. Each library is lightweight, versatile, and can be used independently.

**No dependencies. No transpilation. No bullshit.**

## The Raven Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Zero dependencies** - Every package is self-contained. No more security vulnerabilities from code you didn't write.
- **Modern JavaScript only** - ESNext features without transpilation. Target modern browsers and Node.js 22.5+.
- **Perfect tree-shaking** - Import only what you use. No more "all-or-nothing" framework bloat.
- **JSDoc-powered types** - Full IntelliSense support without TypeScript compilation overhead.
- **Self-documenting APIs** - Every package teaches both humans and AI how to use it correctly.

## The Raven Toolkit

Each library is designed to work independently or together seamlessly:

- **ü¶ú Beak** - Lightweight templating and rendering (HTML, SQL, and more)

_More libraries coming soon - being crafted with care._

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anonyfox/raven-js.git
cd raven-js

# Install dependencies (for development only)
npm install

# Explore the libraries
ls packages/
```

## Why RavenJS?

### For Developers Who Are Tired Of:

- **Dependency hell** - Security vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies
- **Configuration fatigue** - Build configs longer than your actual code
- **Framework lock-in** - Being forced into specific paradigms and toolchains
- **Bundle bloat** - Importing entire frameworks when you only need one function
- **Legacy support** - Holding back modern development for outdated browsers

### RavenJS Offers:

- **Instant setup** - Zero configuration required
- **Modern development** - Use the latest JavaScript features without transpilation
- **Optimal bundles** - Only what you import gets included
- **Type safety** - Full IntelliSense without TypeScript compilation
- **AI-friendly** - Self-documenting APIs that work seamlessly with AI tools
- **Future-proof** - Built for modern environments, not legacy constraints
- **Versatile toolkit** - Mix and match libraries as needed

## Perfect For

- **üöÄ Rapid prototyping** - Get from idea to working demo in hours, not days
- **üì± Small to medium web apps** - Content sites, dashboards, admin panels
- **üè¢ Internal tools** - Applications that need to work reliably for your team
- **üí° MVPs and startups** - Where speed to market beats perfect architecture
- **üîÑ Legacy modernization** - Gradual migration paths without complete rewrites

## Architecture Decisions

### Zero Dependencies

Every RavenJS package is completely self-contained. No external dependencies means:

- No security vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies
- No breaking changes from library updates you didn't ask for
- No bundle bloat from code you don't use
- No "dependency rot" over time

### Modern JavaScript Only

Targeting modern environments (Node.js 22.5+, modern browsers) means:

- No transpilation complexity
- Smaller, faster builds
- Better debugging experience
- Access to the latest language features

### ESM-First Design

Native ES modules with perfect tree-shaking:

- Import only the functions you need
- Optimal bundle sizes
- Better caching and performance
- Native browser support

### JSDoc-Powered Types

Full TypeScript IntelliSense without the compilation step:

- Type safety without TypeScript overhead
- Self-documenting code
- Better IDE support
- No build step required

## Status: Work in Progress

RavenJS is currently in active development. We're crafting each package with care, ensuring they meet our high standards for:

- Zero dependencies
- Modern JavaScript compatibility
- Comprehensive documentation
- AI-friendly APIs
- Real-world usability

**Not ready for production use yet, but getting closer every day.**

## Contributing

RavenJS is built by developers, for developers. We welcome contributions that align with our philosophy:

- Keep it simple and focused
- Zero dependencies
- Modern JavaScript only
- Self-documenting APIs
- AI-friendly design
