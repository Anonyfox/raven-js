config file formats and just want to build and ship, now.

## Using Javascript like it's meant to be nowadays

You probably don't need brittle transpilations like typescript, JSX, ... or even
giant node_modules folders and hate yourself 2 years later when trying to come
back to an app.

- modern ECMAScript features (toplevel await, ...) and leveraging ESM benefits
- use modern platform-native primitives (fetch, sqlite, testrunner, ...) of JS
- JSDoc for typechecking + intellisense/tool support + LLM guidance
- absolutely zero transient dependencies for tiny utilities that rot over time

And most of all: stay independent from all the providers that try to lock you into
their tool-turned-product "conveniences" and magic quirks to learn and keep up with.

As a side effect this keeps the mental complexity as low as possible so LLMs can
vibecode your features without tripping over outdated details/dependencies.
